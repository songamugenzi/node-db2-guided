# DB II Guided Project

Guided project **DB II** Module.

## Prerequisites

- [SQLite Studio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt?act=download) installed.
- a REST client alike [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) installed.
- create a free account for [DB Designer](https://dbdesigner.net).

## Project Setup

- [ ] fork and clone this repository.
- [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned **your fork**.
- [ ] type `npm i` to download dependencies.
- [ ] type `npm run server` to start the API.

Please follow along as the instructor explores schema design with this API.

## Connect Knex to ./data/produce.db3 database file

- `npm i -g knex`
- `knex init` -> creates the `knexfile.js`
- modify the development configuration to point to `./data/produce.db3`
- remove the knex code at the top of `fruits-router.js`
- create a connection file that uses `knexfile.js` to pick the `developent` configuration object.
- use the `connection` file inside `fruits-router` (call it `db`) as the means to access the database.
- run the server and do a GET to `localhost:5000/api/fruits`

## Mantras

- every table MUST have a Primary Key.
- **EVERY** change to the database schema (structure) NEEDS a new migration.

## Migrations

- create a migration: `knex migrate:make migration_name`
- `knex migrate:latest`
